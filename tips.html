        <h2>Useful Training Tips</h2><br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Ahead of your first pack outing it is important that your four-legged-friend is able to walk on the lead and
            has good
            recall in case of an emergency.<br>
            <br>
            We have compiled several videos below that can assit with the training as it can be very frustrating at
            times!
            Dogs respond most effectively to consistency and repetition, and some breeds such as sighthounds can take
            longer than others to learn a new behaviour.<br>
            <br>
            Persevere and you will get there! Good luck!

                Ensuring your dog walks nicely on the lead is essential training for any pup and is best taught from a
                young age, though can be introduced later if you have adopted a rescue.<br>
                <br>
                The primary reason for training your dog to walk nicely on the lead is for their safety. Dogs are much
                more likely to injure themselves if they are out of control and lurching at everything they pass.
                Owners are also more prone to injuries when walking unruly pets. Leash pulling in particular can cause
                rotator cuff injuries in the elderly, and it is more likely that an owner will drop the lead which could
                result in the dog taking off.
                Ultimately an untrained dog will become frustrated and potentially reactive when on the leash.<br>
                <br>
                Consistent leash walking provides a regular, safe mode of exercise for you and your pooch, enhancing
                your bond, and establishing your dominance.

            <p>
                By training your dog to heel you are improving their leash manners and self-control, and creating a much
                more pleasant walking experience for you and your pet.<br>
                <br>
                Heel training ensure your dog remains close to your left hand which is free to dispense treats when the
                pooch is compliant therefore allowing for more control.
                It serves as an effective tool for navigating potentially problematic scenarios such as approaching
                nervous or reactive dogs, crossing busy roads, or traversing
                awkward terrain.<br>
                <br>
                Add heel training to your pet obedience arsenal and enjoy pleasantly well-mannered walks with your
                pooch!

                "Come!" is arguably the most important command you can teach your dog. Having good recall, and the
                ability to return to you when instructed is essential if you are planning to allow your dog off the
                lead.<br>
                <br>
                This can be challenging for young pups and certain easily distracted breeds, and equally frustrating for
                owners, but when successfully taught is an invaluable tool for maintaining control over your dog.
                Distractions for dogs are varied and numerous: other dogs, animals, balls, cyclists etc., so being able
                to disrupt a dog's inquisitiveness or desire to chase and have them return to you on command is powerful
                and can often avert a dangerous scenario such as approaching a reactive or aggressive breed.<br>
                <br>
                This one is definitely worth persevering with and is a prerequisite for attending any of our pack walks.
                Good luck!

                Another great tool to get your dog's attention is the "watch me" or "look at me" command. In a similar
                way to practising heel or recall training, it provides yet another way to distract your dog from
                whatever it is they're doing and focuses them on <em>you</em>.<br>
                <br>
                You will often find yourself in situations wherby it is necessary to interrupt your dog's behaviours,
                such
                as digging the lawn, rooting through a bin or generally getting too excitable. A pup that is trained to
                look its owner in the eyes and maintain eye contact can be immediately disarmed in any situation, which
                is particularly useful when out and about, or when trying to teach a new command.<br>
                <br>
                As with all training, these commands need to be practised in a number of situations, initially indoors
                in a safe environment, then onto areas containing distractions. Once mastered, you will have yourself a
                happy and obedient pooch!<br>
