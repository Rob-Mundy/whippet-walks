# Whippet Walks

[View the live project here](https://rob-mundy.github.io/whippet-walks/)

The Whippet Walks website is a landing page for owners of whippets and sighthound-breed dogs that are interested in meeting up for organised group or "pack" walks in the Norfolk-based districts of Norwich, North Norfolk and Broadlands.

Website users will be able to find out about the group, sign up via a form that is linked via the home page or nav menu, locate the events via embedded Google Maps, link to associated social media sites, and access training videos on a blog-style tips page to ensure their dogs' readiness to join.
