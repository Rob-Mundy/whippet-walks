# Whippet Walks

The Whippet Walks website is a landing page for owners of whippets and sighthound-breed dogs that are interested in meeting up for organised group or "pack" walks in the Norfolk-based districts of Norwich, North Norfolk and Broadlands.

Website users will be able to find out about the group, sign up via a form that is linked via the home page or nav menu, locate the events via embedded Google Maps, and access training videos on a blog-style tips page to ensure that their animals are ready to join.
